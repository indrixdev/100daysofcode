# 100 Days of Code

The repo is all about the #100daysofcode challenge. I will be updating this repo every day with the following,

- Code samples for concepts and how to use them in larger programs
- Code of programs I have written that work / do not work for people to view
- Daily updates with what I have done / plan to do next

All of the code here is free use for anyone, though as a beginner to C++ not certain if that is a good thing haha. If at any
point I follow a tutorial I will link the relevant tutorial along side the code in the README.md files. Though any tutorial 
followed will be changed up so I will not be just copying other code, rather using the tutorial as a base while expanding my own
ideas from them.

### Wish me Luck!
