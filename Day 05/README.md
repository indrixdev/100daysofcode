# What I did today

Weekends are a little harder for me to find the time to code and I also do not code on
Sundays. So for the Saturdays I will be doing the C++ Course through SoloLearn. This will
give me a way to see roughly where I am with regards to syntax etc and hopefully offest
the time I will have spend on googling the basic syntax.

## What I learned

While most of the syntax was familiar to me, there was a few things I learned,

- \n and std::endl both do roughly the same thing
- Better idea of the increment and decrement and the use of those
