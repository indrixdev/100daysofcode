# What I did today

Spent the morning going through Sololearn again, Todays topic was classes, Scope and importing other header files.

## What I learned

- Gained an understanding of how scope works within C++
- Learned how to create header files for your own classes and how to import them into the main file
- Gained a base understanding of classes.
- Learned a little about Object orientated programming

Creating and importing classes was very interesting and would love to put it into practice creating an overhauled
version of my student / admin system from last week.
