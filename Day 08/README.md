# What I did today

Today was spend going through Sololearn and seeing how much I already have experience with due to other
languages and which parts were new.

## What I learned today

- Gained a deeper understanding of using and calling functions
- using args in a function and function overloading
- recursion within C++
- A very base understanding of pointers

### What I Will do next

Having now hit the point on Sololearn where I am learning more than I already know I will be spending a 
few days working through the Sololearn C++ course to further increase my knowledge of the syntax and what
else is doable through C++
