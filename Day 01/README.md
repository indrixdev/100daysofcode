# What I did today

Today was spent on the following;

- Coded the obligatory Hello World as is a must when starting with a new language
- Coded a random number generator that takes input from user and outputs accordingly
- Coded a program to test if a number is divisible by 3 or 5

## Why I chose them

I chose these programs as they teach a few of the base principles used in many different types of programs. For 
example many maths games use a random number generator to generate numbers used in the games. The divisibilty 
calculator again can be used to check answers to math problems and also be adapted to check more more or less numbers.
Hello world is a must have program under any aspiring coders belt as it teaches in my opinion the most fundamental rules of 
programming.. 

## Anyone can code
