Today will be spent building little programs to get some experience in C++ programming.

These programs will not be created using best practice or error handling etc and will be more designed work if used properly only.

The programs I have chosen to code today are, a random number generator, a program that determines whether a given integer is a multiple of 3 or 5 and the obviously required hello world program. The reasons I have chosen to code these specifically is as follows, 

Hello World -- This is the famous entry into learning any new language and as I am learning C++ for the first time I felt it had to be included.
Random number generator -- Many programs I will be learning to create are going to use this such as a text RPG i will be making.
Divisibility calculator -- learning how to manipulate integers in various ways opens up new ways to utilize programming when it comes to solving maths problems.
