# What I did today

### Today was spent on the following;

- Learning the basic syntax of a C++ program
- Practicing declaring and using variables
- Writing simple conditional and loop statements
- Downloading and setting up the Clion IDE from Jetbrains (Hooray for student License)

Day zero was all about setting up my laptop ready to code, having looked at a few IDE's I settled to use Clion
for the duration of command line programming, however once I move onto making GUI programs I will move on to 
Visual Studio Commnunity.
