# What I learned today

Today was a very Meh day and wasnt feeling it however pushing on! Spent a about 20 mins
cursing my IDE for not producing random numbers with each run of a loop, checked everyone
of the settings and all the code, turns out the issue was that the IDE needed to be closed
and opened again... tested code in an online compiler and it worked as intended every time.

## What I learned

I didn't learn much today rather just built a very simple guess the number game to keep me on
track for coding each day. Tomorrow I will be taking this game further by accepting multiple game
modes, extra guesses and hints.
