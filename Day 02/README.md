#Login and Registration Form

Today I coded a basic login form, I made use of two do while loops to only run the program while a certain condition is true. I will be spending today tidying it up
and adding a little more functionality to it. However for the purpose of what I built it for, it has exceeded my expectations.

###Things I learned:

- Do While loops
- Variable comparisons
- Checking if a user input satisfies multiple conditions
- Using functions to keep main function minimal

###Ways to improve on the program

- Connect to a small local database and store multiple users
- Add student schedules unique to each login
- Create an admin account that can modify the news and events variables

All in all this has been an enjoyable project to do and I feel I have learned many things while going through this process and cannot wait to 
push this program even further in the coming days.
