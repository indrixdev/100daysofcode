# What I did today

Today I remade the guess the number game from yesterday though added a little more functionality to the 
game.

## What I learned

- Do while loops are going to be the death of me.
- I need to look a little deeper into which loop style will be better for different programs.

I am not sure what it is but the do while loops I use spiral into an endless loop when the user inputs 
a string instead of an integer in this program. I tried various ways of having the program end if the 
input it recieves does not match the format required but no joy, any assistance on that would be hugely
appreciated.
