# What I did today

Todays plan was to carry on working on my login and registration form, however after playing
snakes and ladders with one of my children yesterday I decided to have a go at seeing what it 
would be like to code it as a, (and I cannot stress this enough!) basic command line program

## What I learned

- Learned about arrays
- Included two new libraries for reading and iterating through arrays 
- Learned about keeping code clean
- What the namespace std is and why to avoid it
- Storing scores in counter variables and concatenating them into cout outputs

Arrays were new to me in C++ though I have used them in other languages they seem to work differently 
when it comes to C++. Even learning how to iterate though them to check if the player had landed on a 
bonus tile for example requires many more steps than most other languages, however watching the program
compile after 30 mins of testing was worth it?! 

Tomorrows project decided after working on this game and will be a board game of my own making, my kids
being the test subjects. There will be maths and grammar questions involved because who doesn't love 
learning while playing a game!
